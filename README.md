## Hamming and Levenshtein Distance
 

**Definition**

* **Hamming distance**  Between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)

* **Levenshtein distance** Is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
